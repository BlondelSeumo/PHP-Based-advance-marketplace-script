[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.3+. This package implements Authorize.Net support for Omnipay.

## Installation

Omnipay is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, simply add it
to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "omnipay/authorizenet": "~2.0"
    }
}
```

And run composer to update your dependencies:

    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar update

## Basic Usage

The following gateways are provided by this package:

* AuthorizeNet_AIM
* AuthorizeNet_CIM
* AuthorizeNet_SIM
* AuthorizeNet_DPM

In addition, `Accept.JS` is supported by the AIM driver. More details are provided below.

For general usage instructions, please see the main [Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay)
repository.

## Accept.JS

This gateway uses a JavaScript script to tokenize credit card details at the front end,
i.e. in the payment form.
Just the tokenized version of the credit card is then sent back to the merchant site,
where it is used as a proxy for the credit card.

The card is tokenized into two values returned in `opaqueData` object from Accept.JS:

* dataDescriptor - the type of opaque data, e.g. "COMMON.ACCEPT.INAPP.PAYMENT"
* dataValue - the value for the opaque data, e.g. "eyJjb2RlIjoiNT... {256 characters} ...idiI6IjEuMSJ9"

These two values must be POSTed back to the merchant application, usually as a part of the payment form.
Make sure the raw credit card details are NOT posted back to your site.
How this is handled is beyond this short note, but examples are always welcome in the documentation.

On the server, the tokenized detailt are passed into the `payment` or `authorize` request object.
You will still need to pass in the `CreditCard` object, as that contains details of the payee and
recipient, but just leave the credit card details of that object blank. For example:

```php
// $gateway is an instantiation of the AIM driver.
// $dataDescriptor and $dataValue come from the paymentr form at the front end.

$request = $gateway->purchase(
    [
        'notifyUrl' => '...',
        'amount' => $amount,
        'opaqueDataDescriptor' => $dataDescriptor,
        'opaqueDataValue' => $dataValue,
        ...
    ]
);
```
