/**
 * Pin Authorize Request
 *
 * The charges API allows you to create new credit card charges, and to retrieve
 * details of previous charges.
 *
 * This message creates a new charge and returns its details. This may be a
 * long-running request.
 *
 * Gateway Parameters
 *
 * * email 	Email address of the customer.  Obtained from the card data.
 * * description 	Description of the item purchased (e.g. "500g of single origin beans").
 * * amount 	Amount to charge in the currencyâ€™s base unit (e.g. cents
 *   for AUD, yen for JPY). There is a minimum charge amount for each
 *   currency; refer to the documentation on supported currencies.
 * * ip_address 	IP address of the person submitting the payment.
 *   Obtained from getClientIp.
 * * Optional currency 	The three-character ISO 4217 currency code of one
 *   of our supported currencies, e.g. AUD or USD. Default value is "AUD".
 * * Optional capture 	Whether or not to immediately capture the charge
 *   ("true" or "false"). If capture is false an authorisation is created.
 *   Later you can capture. Authorised charges automatically expire after
 *   5 days. Default value is "true".
 *
 * and one of the following:

 *
 * <code>
 * // Create a gateway for the Pin REST Gateway
 * // (routes to GatewayFactory::create)
 * $gateway = Omnipay::create('PinGateway');
 *
 * // Initialise the gateway
 * $gateway->initialize(array(
 *     'secretKey' => 'TEST',
 *     'testMode'  => true, // Or false when you are ready for live transactions
 * ));
 *
 * // Create a credit card object
 * // This card can be used for testing.
 * // See https://pin.net.au/docs/api/test-cards for a list of card
 * // numbers that can be used for testing.
 * $card = new CreditCard(array(
 *             'firstName'    => 'Example',
 *             'lastName'     => 'Customer',
 *             'number'       => '4200000000000000',

 *     'card'                     => $card,
 * ));
 * $response = $transaction->send();
 * if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
 *     echo "Authorize transaction was successful!\n";
 *     $sale_id = $response->getTransactionReference();
 *     echo "Transaction reference = " . $sale_id . "\n";
